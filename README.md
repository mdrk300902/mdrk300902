# Hello, I'm Danish — @mdrk300902

I’m a final-year Computer Science student with strong grasp of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI/Generative AI. My passion lies in building intelligent systems, solving complex data-driven problems, and staying on the edge of emerging technologies.

## What I Do
- Designing and training deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs, GANs)
- Building NLP applications, including language understanding, information extraction, and summarization
- Exploring Generative AI, including transformers, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Analyzing complex datasets using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Implementing end-to-end ML pipelines and integrating MLOps practices

## Currently Focused On
- Developing intelligent applications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance context-aware responses
- Researching efficient LLM deployment and scalable inference techniques
- Deepening expertise in AI model evaluation, interpretability, and real-world deployment

## Let's Connect
I'm always open to collaborating on AI/ML projects, research ideas, or open-source initiatives.
